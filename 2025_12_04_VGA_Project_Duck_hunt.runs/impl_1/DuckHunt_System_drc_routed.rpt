RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 U_Bomb1_ROM/data_reg_0 has an input control pin U_Bomb1_ROM/data_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: U_Bomb1_ROM/sel[11]) which is driven by a register (U_VGA_Syncher/U_Pixel_Counter/v_counter_reg[3]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
