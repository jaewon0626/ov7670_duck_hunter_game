WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 U_Bomb1_ROM/data_reg_0 has an input control pin U_Bomb1_ROM/data_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: U_Bomb1_ROM/sel[11]) which is driven by a register (U_VGA_Syncher/U_Pixel_Counter/v_counter_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
